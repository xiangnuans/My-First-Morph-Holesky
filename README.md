# Morph Examples

The code examples in this repository will range from deploying simple contracts on Morph to building full stack dApps that leverage Morph as its L2. More examples will be added to this repository and we are open for suggestions on code examples you may want to see in the future.

## Getting Started

### [contract-deploy-demo](https://github.com/morph-l2/morph-examples/tree/main/contract-deployment-demos)

This directory includes projects that demonstrate how to use hardhat or foundry to deploy a contract in Morph's rollup network. 

This project contains a simple contract that will lock a certain amount of Ether in the deployed contract for a specified amount of time.

## Miscellaneous

### [create2-demo](https://github.com/morphl2/morph-examples/tree/main/contract-deploy-demo)

This project demonstrates how to use the `create2` opcode and tests it across various networks.

### [gas-estimation-demo](https://github.com/morphl2/morph-examples/tree/main/contract-deploy-demo)

This project demonstrates how to use estimate gas on Morph
